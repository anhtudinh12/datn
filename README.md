# Final Year Project
## Information
- PROJECT: "Design water metering system for apartment"
- MAJOR: Electrical engineering and Automation
- College: School of Electronics and Electrical engineering (SEEE), Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)
- DATE: 25/3/2023.

## Summary
The project design a system which meters the water usage for 3 parameters:
- Volume of cold water
- Volume of hot water
- Temperature of hot water

The data is then sent to the web server via NB-IoT and MQTT. The web server will calculate the water bill based on above parameters.
